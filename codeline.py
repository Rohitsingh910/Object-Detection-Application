STARTING HUMAN + OBJECT DETECTION ENGINE

============================================================
      HUMAN + OBJECT DETECTION APPLICATION (YOLOv5)
============================================================

Developer  : Rohit Singh
Technology : Computer Vision | Deep Learning | AI
Model Used : YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once)
Language   : Python

------------------------------------------------------------
PROJECT OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------

The Human + Object Detection Application is a Python-based
real-time computer vision system designed to detect humans
and objects from live camera feeds, video files, or images.

This application integrates a modern Graphical User Interface
(GUI) with an interactive terminal that simulates live code
execution, providing a futuristic and engaging user experience.

The system is powered by the YOLOv5 deep learning model,
known for its high speed and accuracy in real-time object
detection tasks.

------------------------------------------------------------
KEY FEATURES
------------------------------------------------------------

[1] REAL-TIME HUMAN DETECTION
- Detects human presence accurately in live video streams.
- Supports Webcam, Mobile Camera (DroidCam), Video Files,
  and Image inputs.
- Displays the total number of detected humans in real time.

[2] REAL-TIME OBJECT DETECTION
- Detects multiple objects along with humans using YOLOv5.
- High-speed inference optimized for real-time performance.
- Bounding boxes and labels rendered dynamically on frames.

[3] INTERACTIVE & FUTURISTIC GUI
- Built using Tkinter with a full-screen cyber-style interface.
- Interactive buttons for:
    • Launching Camera
    • Connecting to Mobile Camera
    • Selecting Video Files
    • Selecting Images
    • Displaying Presentation Slides
- Live terminal simulation with dynamic code typing effects.

[4] AUDIO-VISUAL ENHANCEMENTS
- Loading animations with rotating graphics.
- Background sound effects using Pygame.
- Real-time clock and system-like UI elements.
